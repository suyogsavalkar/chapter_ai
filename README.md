   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

   # Database (Neon Postgres)
   DATABASE_URL=your-neon-database-url

   # AI Provider (choose one or multiple)
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-key

   # App Integrations (configure as needed)
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
   SLACK_CLIENT_ID=your-slack-client-id
   SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET=your-slack-client-secret

   # Optional: Vercel AI Gateway
   AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY=your-ai-gateway-key
   ```

4. **Set up the database**

   ```bash
   pnpm db:push
   ```

5. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

   Chapter will be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### First Time Setup

1. **Create your account** - Visit the app and sign up with your preferred authentication method

2. **Connect your first app** - Start by connecting one of your frequently used applications (Gmail, Slack, etc.)

3. **Try your first command** - Ask Chapter to do something simple like "Show me my recent emails" or "What meetings do I have today?"

4. **Explore integrations** - Visit the Apps section to connect more of your workflow tools

## Configuration

### Database Setup

Chapter uses Neon Postgres for data persistence. To set up your database:

1. Create a free account at [Neon](https://neon.tech)
2. Create a new project and database
3. Copy the connection string to your `.env.local` file
4. Run the database migrations: `pnpm db:push`

### AI Provider Configuration

Chapter supports multiple AI providers. Configure at least one:

**OpenAI (Recommended)**

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key
```

**Anthropic Claude**

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-key
```

**Vercel AI Gateway (For production)**

```bash
AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY=your-gateway-key
```

### App Integrations

Each connected app requires OAuth credentials. Here's how to set up the most common ones:

#### Google Workspace

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Create a new project or select existing
3. Enable Gmail, Calendar, and Drive APIs
4. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials
5. Add your credentials to `.env.local`

#### Slack

1. Visit [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Create a new app
3. Configure OAuth scopes for the permissions you need
4. Add credentials to `.env.local`

#### GitHub

1. Go to GitHub Settings > Developer settings > OAuth Apps
2. Create a new OAuth app
3. Set authorization callback URL to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github`
4. Add credentials to `.env.local`

## Usage Examples

Once Chapter is running, you can interact with it using natural language:

### Email Management

```
"Send an email to john@company.com about the project update"
"Show me all unread emails from this week"
"Schedule a meeting with the design team for tomorrow at 2 PM"
```

### Document Creation

```
"Create a project proposal document in Google Docs"
"Generate a weekly report based on our Slack conversations"
"Make a presentation about our Q4 results"
```

### Task Management

```
"Add a task to follow up with the client next week"
"Show me all overdue tasks across my project management tools"
"Create a new project in Linear for the mobile app redesign"
```

### Cross-App Workflows

```
"When I receive an email with 'urgent' in the subject, create a high-priority task in Todoist"
"Summarize today's Slack messages and add them to my daily notes in Notion"
"Create a GitHub issue for every bug report in our support channel"
```
